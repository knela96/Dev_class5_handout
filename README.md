# Innovation 

Pressing the spacebar while in the air lets you glide for two seconds, letting you be more accurate when landing, 
besides this, when you fall from a platform you don't respawn at the start of the level, but the last position you were on ground.
The player can attack and kill enemies with a tail move.
